It is a creational design pattern.
Need : When there is a superclass and multiple subclasses
We create objects  without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a 
common interface.

Client should not be responsible for creation of objects.
Class should not be tightly coupled 
Hence we need Factory design pattern.

Advantages:
Focus on interface not on implementation.
We get loose coupling
Code is more robust
