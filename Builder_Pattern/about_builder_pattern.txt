Problems of Factory Design Pattern:
1.) If there are multiple parameters then we have to pass all of them into the constructors.
problem is a.) to remember the order.
           b.) If any parameter is optional then we have to overload the constructor.
Factory class takes all the responsibility by creating an object. If the object is heavy then all the complexity
is part of factory class.

Solution: Create object step by step.; Use builder Pattern

builder pattern helps in creating objects that are immutable. by not giving setter methods 
If we give setter methods then it is mutable.
