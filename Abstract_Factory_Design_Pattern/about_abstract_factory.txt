Factory pattern deals with creation of objects of single type while abstract factory pattern deals with the 
creation of objects of related types.

Creates families of related class without imposing their concrete classes.
e.g : Computer Factory -> Laptop Factory -> Types of Laptops
Computer Factory -> PC Factory -> Types of PC

It is factory of factories.

Advantages:
1.) Provides approach to code for interface rather than implementation
2.) Factory of factories
3.) Robust and avoids conditional logic of Factory pattern.
