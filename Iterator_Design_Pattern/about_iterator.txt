If the object has followed Iterator design pattern then we can traverse any type of Object.

interface has 2 methods : hasNext() tells true or false if next element is present, next() moves pointer to 
next element

Iterator design pattern provides a way to access the elements of an object without exposing its underlying 
representation.
